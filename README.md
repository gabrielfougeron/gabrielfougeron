Hi, My name is Gabriel Fougeron.
For the past ten years I've been working at ESI-Group as a research engineer. My work focuses on simulation and optimization topics in continuum mechanics. Lately, I've mainly been working on applications of optimal transport to reduced order modelling of the simulation of manufacturing processes.

I’ve also invested unreasonable amounts of time in small pet projects across the years. The latest of them is an open-source python library for the computation of periodic N-body gravitational orbits. You can experiment with the web-app demo at [this address](https://gabrielfougeron.github.io/choreo/), no installation required!
